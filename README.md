## **The Origin of Plugfy**
The **Plugfy** project was born in **2017**, within an industrial context, to address the challenges of integration and communication between different systems, business rules, and heterogeneous environments. 
Initially focused on negotiation flows and customizable modules, it quickly became a powerful solution for managing complexity in corporate environments.

In **2023**, the framework was completely modernized, introducing a new architecture focused on **work pipelines**, **distributed execution**, and **extensibility**. This evolution expanded its capabilities to operate at the system level and in virtualized environments, making it ideal for modern IT scenarios.
