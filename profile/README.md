**Plugfy Core** is an open-source framework developed by the **Plugfy Foundation** to simplify, standardize, and accelerate the development of complex systems. 
Its modular and scalable architecture enables the creation of flexible, dynamic, and highly reusable applications by efficiently and transparently integrating modules and business workflows.

## **The Origin of Plugfy**
The **Plugfy** project was born in **2017**, within an industrial context, to address the challenges of integration and communication between different systems, business rules, and heterogeneous environments. 
Initially focused on negotiation flows and customizable modules, it quickly became a powerful solution for managing complexity in corporate environments.

In **2023**, the framework was completely modernized, introducing a new architecture focused on **work pipelines**, **distributed execution**, and **extensibility**. This evolution expanded its capabilities to operate at the system level and in virtualized environments, making it ideal for modern IT scenarios.
